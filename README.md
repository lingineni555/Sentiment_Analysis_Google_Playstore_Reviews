# Sentiment Analysis on Google Playstore Reviews using Tidy Text of R
In this project we want to understand customerâ€™s expectations towards mobile messaging applications and help our client find insights that will help them launch their new messaging application in May 2021.

We are mainly focusing on three android messaging applications which are WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. We extracted 60 reviews from each of these applications using google_play_scrapper API.

We used Tidy Text to perform sentiment analysis on these reviews and extracted trends & insights, using which we preparea an actionable business plan.
